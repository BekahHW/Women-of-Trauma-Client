  <p style={pStyle}>“Traumatic events, by definition, overwhelm our ability to cope.When the mind becomes flooded with emotion, a circuit breaker is thrown that allows us to survive the experience fairly intact, that is, without becoming psychotic or frying out one of the brain centers.The cost of this blown circuit is emotion frozen within the body.In other words, we often unconsciously stop feeling our trauma partway into it, like a movie that is still going after the sound has been turned off.We cannot heal until we move fully through that trauma, including all the feelings of the event.”
